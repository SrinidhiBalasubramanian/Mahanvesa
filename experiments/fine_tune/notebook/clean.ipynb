Here Nara and Narayana, Brahma, Yama and the fifth Sthanu performed sacrifices after the expiration of one thousand Yugas. Here for the establishment of virtue and religion Vasudeva with with pious devotion performed his sacrifices with extended for many long years. Where Keshava placed thousands and tens of thousands of sacrificial stakes adorned with garlands of gold and innumerable (sacrificial) altars of great splendour. O descendant of Bharata, going there he (Maya) brought the club, the conch shall and the various articles of crystal which belonged to Vrishaparva, (the Danava king). Going there thereat Asura, Maya, took all the great wealth which was guarded by the Takshas and Rakshasas and Kinkaras. Bringing them away, the Asura (Maya) built with them a matchless assembly-hall. It was celebrated throughout the three worlds, it was beautiful, it was celestials, and it was full of gems and jewels. He gave to Bhimasena that best of clubs (that was in the lake) he also gave to Arjuna that excellent and the best conch. The sound of that conch used to make all creatures tremble in feat. O great king, the assembly-hall that Maya built, stood on golden pillars, and it occupied an area of five thousand cubits square, possessing an most beautiful form. It (the liall) shone in great splendour like the fire, the sun or the moon. By its great effulgence it seemed to darken even the rays of the sun. With its effulgence which was the mixture of both celestials and terrestrial light, it appeared as if it was on fire. Like a mass of new clouds rising in the sky, it filled the whole of the view. It was spacious large, charming, soothing, full of celestials effulgence, and filled with all sorts of excellent things, it was adorned with jeweled walls and gates, with many pictures and much wealth. It appeared like the work of Vishvakarma himself. The Sudharma (the assembly-hall) of the Dasharhas (Vrishnis)-nay even the abode of Brahma was not so grand and endued with so much beauty as this assembly-hall built by the intelligent Maya. Being appointed by Maya, eight thousand Rakshasas, named Kinkaras, guarded and supported this assembly-hall. They were capable of ranging the sky, they were fearful, huge-bodied, and greatly strong; they had blood-like red and coppery eyes and arrowy-ears, they were all well-armed. In that assembly-hall Maya built a matchless tank, and in that tank were lilies with leaves made of dark-coloured gems and with stalks made of brilliant gems; there were also other aquatic flowers of golden leaves. Various kinds of water-fowls played in its water; it was adorned with full-blossomed lotuses; its water was transparent; and golden-coloured tortoises and fishes played in its bottom which was without mud. A flight of crystal steps rose from the edge of the water to the banks, The gentle breeze shook the flowers that sudden its waters; its banks were adorned with costly marble slabs set with pearls. Seeing that tank thus adorned with jewels and precious stones, many kings that came there mistook it for land, and they fell into it with their eyes open.',\n",
       " 'positive': '. are The preceptor said, “You should not appropriate what you receive by begging without offering it to me. \" Being thus told he went away and offered all that he got by begging to his preceptor; And the preceptor took from him all that he got. He, being thus treated, went away to look after the cattle. And after having tended them all day he came back in the evening. He stood before his preceptor and respectfully saluted him. The preceptor, seeing him still as plump as before, said, “Upamanyu, my child. I take from you all that you get by begging. How do you contrive to support yourself now?” Being thus questioned, he answered to his preceptor, “Sir, after giving you all I get by begging, I go again to beg to support myself. ” The preceptor, said “This is not the way you should obey your preceptor. You diminish the support of others who live by begging. Having thus supported yourself you have showed that you are coveteous. Having assented to all his preceptor\\'s words, he went away (again) to tend the kine Having done it, he stood before the preceptor and respectfully saluted him. The preceptor saw that he was still plump and said, \"Upamanyu, my child, I take from you all that you get by begging. You do not also go out begging for the second time. How do you now manage to support yourself?” Upamanyu, thus questioned, replied, “Sir, I now support myself with the milk of these cows. ” Hearing which the preceptor said, “It is not proper for you to drink the milk, since you were not addressed by me. \" He assented to his preceptor\\'s words and went to tend the cattle. Having done it he stood before his preceptor and respectfully saluted him. The preceptor saw that he was still fat and he asked, “Upamanyu my child, you do not support yourself by alms, nor do you go begging for the second time, nor do you drink the milk of my cows, but you are still fat, how do you support yourself now?\" Thus questioned he said, “I now drink the froth that the calves throw out when they suck their mother\\'s teats. \" The preceptor replied, “The good calves, out of kindness towards you, throw out a large quantity of froth. You should not stand in the way of their full meal. Know, it is not proper for you to drink the froth. ” Upamanyu assented to this and went to tend the cattle. Thus prevented by his preceptor (from supporting himself,) he did not feed on alms, he did not drink the milk, or taste the froth, he had thus nothing to eat. One day being very much oppressed by hunger he ate the leaves of Arka tree in a forest. His eyes were affected by the pungent, acrimonious, crude and saline qualities of the leaves and he became blind. When he was thus walking about feeling his way he fell into a deep well. As he did not return that day to the Rishi\\'s house when the sun was sinking down behind the summit of the western mountain, the preceptor said to his pupils that Upamanyu had not yet returned. And they replied that he had gone to the forest to tend the cattle. On this the preceptor said, Upamanyu is displeased, because he has been prevented from the use of everything. He is therefore, making late to come home. Let us go and find him out. \" Having said this, he went with his pupils into the forest and called aloud. “Ho, Upamanyu, where are you? My child, come here. \" Having heard the voice of his preceptor he replied, “I have fallen into this well. ” The preceptor asked, “How have you fallen into this well?\"',\n",
       " 'negatives': [\". A piece of iron, which is inanimate runs towards a piece of loadstone. Likewise, inclinations and propensities due to natural instincts, and all else, run towards the Soul in a 11cw lifc. Indeed, as those propensities bom of Darkness and Ignorance, and inactive in their nature, are united with the Soul when re-born, similarly, those other inclinations and aspirations of the Soul that have their look directed towards Brahma become united with it, coming to it directly from Brahima itself. Neither earth, nor sky, nor heaven, nor things, nor the vital airs, nor virtue and vice, nor anything else, existed before, except the Intelligence-Soul. Nor have they any necessary connection with even the Intelligence-Soul corrupted by Darkness. The Soul is eternal. It is indestructible. It is in every creature. It is the cause of the Mind. It is without qualities. This universe before us is due to Darkness or Ignorance. The Soul's apprehensions of form, etc., are due to past desires. The Soul, when it becomes endued with desires, engages in acts. On account of that condition, this vast wheel of existence revolves with beginning and without end. The Understanding, is the nave of that wheel. The body with the senses, forms its spokes. The perceptions and acts are its circumference. Urged by on the quality of Darkness, the Soul presides over it. Like oilmen pressing oilseeds pressing oilseeds in their machine, the consequences born of Darkness, assailing the universe which is moistened by Darkness, press or grind it in that wheel. In that succession of births, the individual Soul, seized by the idea of Ego in consequence of desire, performs acts. In the union of cause and effect, those acts again become fresh causes. Effects do not enter into causes. Nor do causes enter into effects. Time is the instrumental in the production of effects. The primordial essences, and their changes endued with causes, exist unitedly, on account of their being always presided over by the Soul. Like dust following the wind that moves it, the individual Soul, shorn of body, but endued still with inclinations born of Darkness and Ignorance with principles of causes formed by pristine deeds, moves on, following the direction of the Supreme Soul. The Soul, however, is never affected by those inclinations and propensities. Nor are these affected by the Soul that is superior to them. The wind, which is naturally pure, is never sullied by the dust it carries. As the wind is separate from the dust it carries away, so, the wise man should know, is the connection between life and the Soul. No one should think that the Soul, on account of its seeming union with the body and the senses and the other inclinations and beliefs and unbeliefs, is really endued therewith as its necessary and absolute qualities. On the other hand, the Soul should be considered as existing in its own nature.\",\n",
